    <h1>Gentrification in The Bronx</h1>
    <p>The Bronx is currently in the early stages of gentrification, with areas like the South Bronx and Fordham seeing gradual change.</p>

    <h2>Historic Gentrification</h2>
    <p>Historically, the Bronx has been an area of disinvestment, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s. However, recent years have seen increased development, particularly in the South Bronx. The Yankee Stadium area has undergone major revitalization, and new commercial and residential developments have begun appearing in traditionally low-income areas.</p>

    <h2>Possible Reasons</h2>
    <p>As other boroughs have become more expensive, developers and new residents have begun to look to the Bronx as the "next frontier" of gentrification. Proximity to Manhattan, along with public investments in infrastructure and affordable housing programs, are driving forces behind the change.</p>

    <h2>Future Analysis</h2>
    <p>The Bronx will likely see increased gentrification in the coming years, with the South Bronx at the forefront. There is potential for increased tension between new developments and existing residents, especially as rents rise. Community groups are working to ensure that gentrification does not result in mass displacement.</p>
