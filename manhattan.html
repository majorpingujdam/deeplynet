    <h1>Gentrification in Manhattan</h1>
    <p>Manhattan's gentrification is well-known, with areas like Harlem, the Lower East Side, and the East Village undergoing significant transformation.</p>

    <h2>Historic Gentrification</h2>
    <p>Harlem, once a predominantly African-American cultural hub, began gentrifying in the 1990s as developers saw the potential of its historic brownstones and proximity to central Manhattan. The Lower East Side, known for its immigrant communities and punk rock culture, has seen waves of gentrification since the early 2000s, as luxury apartments replaced older tenement buildings.</p>

    <h2>Possible Reasons</h2>
    <p>As Manhattan's prime real estate became more desirable, higher-income residents moved into traditionally lower-income neighborhoods. Public and private investment in infrastructure, along with incentives for development, encouraged rapid transformation. The influx of high-end retail and dining options accelerated the process.</p>

    <h2>Future Analysis</h2>
    <p>Manhattan is likely to continue seeing skyrocketing rents and increasing wealth concentration. There is concern over the continued loss of affordable housing, with longtime residents being pushed out of neighborhoods they’ve lived in for generations. Efforts to preserve affordable housing are critical, but market forces remain strong.</p>
